# parse-pages-from-Wikipedia
This is a C program that parses pages from the site Wikipedia using Câ€™s text processing functions found in <string.h>. 

Print the names of all links to other Wikipedia pages that you find to the terminal

Those links appear in this form:

" <a href="/wiki/PageName" maybe some junk title="PageName">easy to read description</a> "

every PageName printed should mean https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageName is a valid web page.
